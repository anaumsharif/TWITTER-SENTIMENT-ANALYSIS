# Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis-
This project was created as a MINI  PROJECT for practicing NLP and python frameworks 
A Twitter sentiment analysis determines negative, positive, or neutral emotions within the text of a tweet using NLP and ML models. Sentiment analysis or opinion mining refers to identifying as well as classifying the sentiments that are expressed in the text source.
It is also known as opinion mining, deriving the opinion or attitude of a speaker. 
Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to comprehend, generate, and manipulate human language.
NLP IS concerned with giving computers the ability to understand text and spoken words in much the same way human beings can.
NLP combines computational linguistics—rule-based modeling of human language—with statistical, machine learning, and deep learning models.
Together these technologies enable computers to process human language in the form of text or voice data and to understand its full meaning.
